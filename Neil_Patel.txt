Hi, my name is Neil Patel. I am a sophomore studying bioengineering at the 
University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. 

Currently on campus I am a part of Phi Chi Theta Professional Fraternity, 
a member of Engineering Council, and a team lead of an EOH team on campus.

During my free time I love to play sports such as volleyball and basketball 
and watch the Chicago sports teams such as the Bears and Bulls. 

Fun fact, I love sports trivia and I can name all 123 major US sports in less
than 5 minutes on a trivia website called Sporcle. 

My future goals and aspirations involve working in the medical device industry 
on a product development team. Long term, I want to start my own company that
combines and skillset and love for sports!
