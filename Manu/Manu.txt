Wassup! Hi my name is Manu Mehta. I am a freshman in bioengineering. I was interested in joining this design team 
so that I could improve my skills in programming and learn the opportunities that bioengineering has.

When I'm not working on homework or studying, I spend my time talking to friends,
watching bad horror movies, and playing/watching basketball.
