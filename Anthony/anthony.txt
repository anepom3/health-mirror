Hi, my name is Anthony Nepomuceno. I'm a junior computer engineering student at 
the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

I love learning more about the awesome innovations and applications Digital
Signal Processing (DSP) has to offer. I'm especially intrigued by applications
to the Health Care sector including Biomedical Instrumentation and Imaging.

When I'm not working on ECE 385 and ECE 310 this semester, you can usually find
me at Newman either eating, laughing, or praying with friends. My favorite color
is a soft pastel mint green, and you can't go wrong with a cup of tea with an
old friend.  

I'm looking forward to a great semester working with my BMES Design Team. It's
going to be a great semester!
