Hello all!

My name is Emma Erickson, I am a junior studying electrical engineering at the University of Illinois at 
Urbana-Champaign. My focus is in signal processing, so that's what drew me to this project initially :)

Likes:
- DSP
- ice skating
- practicing German
- watching movies

- To be continued ;)

I'm excited to be working with BMES on the health mirror, to EOH and beyond!
