Hi! My name is Paymon, and I'm a freshman in Bioengineering. Some things I like to do are play jazz on my saxophone and workout. As a kid, my dad took me to the San Francisco Exploratorium, and I loved seeing how the science and math I was learning in school was being used to change the world! That's why I decided to study engineering. My role in the project is to put together our mask that measures your breathing rate using lots of electrical parts, and to make sure it works. My favorite food is pasta, and some of my favorite shows are Avatar the Last Airbender and Parks and Recreation!
